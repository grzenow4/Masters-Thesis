20;66000;26;Hump Installationer for pedestrians.;Streets, Sidewalks & Transit;Speed humps create a safer environment by helping slow traffic on streets that students and families cross frequently. When a car hits a pedestrian at a high rate of speed, the collision is more likely to result in a pedestrian fatality. Speed humps slow vehicles and give drivers increased response time and distance for stopping. This makes streets safer for pedestrians.
